Facial Expression Recognition using CNNs

This project implements a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify human facial expressions from images. It is trained on a labeled dataset and includes various techniques to improve performance and reduce overfitting.

 🔍 Key Features

- 📈 Data Augmentation**: Applied transformations such as rotation, shear, zoom, and horizontal flip to enhance training data diversity.
- 🧠 CNN Architecture**: Built with convolutional, max-pooling, batch normalization, and dropout layers.
- 🧪 Regularization**: Included dropout to prevent overfitting and improve generalization on unseen data.
- 🖼️ Multi-class Classification**: Supports the prediction of various facial emotion categories such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, and more.
